## 1. What is Arable, and how is it different?

Arable is built on the foundation of cutting-edge R&D in the areas of Deep
Learning, Cryptocurrency-powered Metaphysical Logistics, Sumeroakkadian
Orbital Space Chariot Dynamics in the Finjanian tradition, as well as Female
Logic in the Kadean tradition.

Arable believes in proactive and highly reactive approaches taken to
security and reliability in the longest of terms and not only carries them
into practice, but also enhances them with a rich and truly advanced set
of features such as Retroactive Security and Deletion-Oriented Security,
which have been employed to augment less transcendent security strategies
with tremendous success.

## 1.1. Success stories

  
"Before I was ~~forced at gunpoint~~ introduced to the wonderful Arable
tool, our security used to be so horrible, it was basically a joke. But
with Arable's novel and, quite frankly, radical approaches to security,
all of our security concerns were addressed by deleting all of my
co-employees from existence by exposing them to 300 hungry lions. Then
the building was subjected to an extensive nuclear bombing campaign. Now
we don't have to worry about security anymore. Thanks, Arable!"  
**Success story**: *Neil O'Dickhead, Bullshit Software Ltd., Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England*
  
  
"Well, I think that its mainly bollocks, really. Me mate Å ubannilum
said so too. Sometimes I wish I were an Amorite. Oh, Arable? We use it
all the time, it's really good!"  
**Success story**: *Gazimbi the farmer, Eridu, Third Dynasty of Ur, Neo-Sumerian Empire*
